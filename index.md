I'm a Data Analytics and Business Operations Leader with over a decade of experience in Technology and SaaS. My career has focused on building scalable data systems, leading cross-functional teams, and driving cross-functional initiatives that deliver measurable business outcomes.

In my most recent role as Director of Data Analytics & BizOps at Xola, I built the company's data infrastructure from the ground up and managed a diverse team of data, marketing, and operations professionals. I thrive at the intersection of data and business operations, helping organizations make informed decisions and solve complex challenges.

Beyond my professional experience, I hold an MBA with a concentration in Business Intelligence and have pursued advanced training in growth strategy and data science. I'm passionate about mentoring teams, optimizing processes, and creating a collaborative culture that empowers people to excel.
