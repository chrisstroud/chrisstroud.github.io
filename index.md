I'm a BizOps & Data professional with over a decade of experience. My career has focused on building scalable data systems/teams, building and managaging cross-functional teams, and going zero to one with complex initiatives.

In my most recent role as Director of Data Analytics & BizOps at Xola, I built the company's data infrastructure from the ground up and managed a diverse team of data, marketing, and operations professionals. I thrive at the intersection of data and BizOps, helping organizations make informed decisions and solve complex challenges.

<b>I'm currently looking for my next opportunity and would love to connect.</b>
